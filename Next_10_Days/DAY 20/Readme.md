# Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage

- #### Task 1:

  Write a script to save a string value to localstorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.

- #### Task 2:
  Write a script to save an object to localstorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 2: Using LocalStorage

- #### Task 3:

  Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to localstorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.

- #### Task 4:
  Write a script to remove an item from localstorage. Log the localstorage content before and after removal.

### Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage

- #### Task 5:

  Write a script to save a string value to sessionStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.

- #### Task 6:
  Write a script to save an object to sessionstorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 4: Using SessionStorage

- #### Task 7:

  Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to sessionstorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.

- #### Task 8:
  Write a script to remove an item from sessionStorage. Log the sessionStorage content before and after removal.

### Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage

- #### Task 9:

  Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both localstorage and sessionstorage. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.

- #### Task 10:
  Write a function that clears all data from both localstorage and sessionStorage. Verify that both storages are empty.
